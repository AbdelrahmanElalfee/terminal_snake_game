# Terminal Snake Game

Welcome to the Terminal Snake Game! This classic arcade-style game brings the thrill of maneuvering a snake through obstacles right to your command line. Written in Python, it's a simple yet addictive experience that challenges your reflexes and strategic thinking.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply run the Python script snakeGame.py. The snake will start moving automatically, and you can control its direction using the arrow keys.

Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging.
